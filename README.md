	So much for beauty

As he awoke, the room was dimly lit
By the pale shades of X-ray
Thrown into by their smallest sun.

He opened his seven eyes,
as he heard Her at the entrance hall.

Slightly hungover from his habit,
cryogen cocktails, too many of them,
he swung on 8 of his pedes to
   open up for Her,
trying to make a good impression (or at least
an impression at all, he thought), he turned into a sphere
as She entered, raising 4 of Her 12 pedes as a greeting.

He always thought he'd make a pretty good sphere,
but whenever She entered his range,
and He became aware of Her beautiful visual antennae 
and Her slander and even tentacles...
The low, color-gliding radiation She seemed to swim in 
made his four hearts pound and his antennae shiver...

...and desperated him in the feeling
of his commonness in front of Her divinity, Her sublimity

Words, were they good enough for Her, or would he fail...

When She left, everything seemed to get darker, fading

The third sun had risen meanwhile,
and between his sixth and seventh cryo
he knew he'd never be able to keep Her happy
		to hold Her high....
